# Blackjack

This is my first project for my Software Engineering program at Per Scholas. I selected to do Blackjack (21) as it is a pretty simple game with straightforward rules, but I wanted to make it look really nice and work on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Rules

You and the dealer (House) start of with 2 cards each. The dealer will have 1 card face up and the other face down. The purpose of the game is to get as close to 21 (or to get 21) as possible without going over 21. If you go over 21, you are busted. Each person will take a turn and can either "Hit" or "Stay." 

The player (You) will start first. If you choose to "Hit", you will receive another card. You can keep "Hitting" until you either get under 21 (or 21) or you bust (you get over 21). 

When you have gotten the score you want (e.g., you have 3 cards for a total of 20 points) and you want to end your turn, you choose the option "Stay." You can choose the "Stay" option at any time to end your turn (e.g. If you start out with 2 cards equaling 20). 

Once the player's turn ends, the dealer (House) will take their turn. They will make their choices (randomized choices). If they choose to "Hit", they will receive a card (face down). If they choose to "Stay", the game will check to see who has won.

There are 8 total rounds in my game.
